		<p><strong>General Overview</strong></p>
		<p><strong>I was born in South Africa and moved to America when I was young. My family settled in Alabama where I finished high school and some college. After much thought, I made the decision to join the Marine Corps where I was assigned the job of a systems administrator. Although I enjoyed the experience and the benefits, it wasn`t quite right for me. August 8, 2018 I was honorably discharged and moved to my wife`s home state of Wisconsin. I am looking forward to the challenge of becoming a developer and settling into this beautiful state. </strong></p><br>

		<p><strong>The Rest</strong></p>
		<p><strong>I made the choice to become a developer after trying many different career attempts. When none of them fit, developing fell in my lap and I couldn`t be happier about it. I have always had an affinity for computers and understanding how they work so it would only make sense that I would spend my life doing just that and helping to solve problems that people and companies run into.</strong></p>
